1 persond doesnt think there can be a general solution

1 person suggests keeping track of prev projects

1 person suggests algorithms using grouped tasks

1 person suggests tayloring solution to each particular person
	goes on to suggests its not practical to ask each student how much time they spent

1 person suggests cataloguing guess vs real logging
	counter suggests data points are limited

1 person suggests using data from multiple students

1 person suggests bringing up personality test to solve problem.

1 person suggests tracking time vs progress 


ideas so far (0745)
	taking individual historical
	taking group historical
	making personality test
	find general forumla for how long an estimate takes
	assign timing based on assignment weight




TODO: 
	Tune metrics to suggested ideas
	Adjust and cleaen up metrics
	Clean up different types of information
	Lyndon wasn't completely clear on what the design could be
		get more specific with metrics (should take a set of inputs, give these outputs, etc.)
			Make point to explor types of models that work
	make reference to diagram more explecit

\section{Metrics}
        The following listed individual metrics will be determined based on the above objectives.
    \begin{subs}
        \subsection{Deviations of Time Approximates}
        A quantitative metric that measures the average ratio between time estimates and actual task duration as:
        \begin{center}
            $\frac{estimates-actual}{actual}\cdot 100\%$
        \end{center}
        This measurement will be in percentile form(\%) using at least 3 trials for different categories of tasks. Providing a relative reference instead of an absolute value will allow comparisons, thus demonstrating the actual precision of potential solutions. 
        \subsection{Personalization of solutions}
        A qualitative metric that follows the rubrics below:
        
        \subsection{Number of Available Accessible Platform}
        A quantitative metric that measures the number of 
        \subsection{Tool-learning effectiveness for Users}
        A quantitative metric
        \subsection{Information Security for Users}
        A quantitative metric
    \end{subs}
