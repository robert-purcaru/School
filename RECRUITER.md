# School
Hi!

This is where I keep files from school related courses and activities.

Please note this isn't an exaustive collection of my coursework, specifically as it relates to programming. If you're reading this,
I have yet to upload any of the work I did in C and course work related to electronics. 

A lot of it won't be that interested but if you're interested in anything in particular, please follow this:

VERILOG:         School\Second_Year\ECE253\{lab2-lab6}
ARM ASSEMBLY:    School\Second_Year\ECE253\{lab7-lab9}
PYTHON:          School\First_Year\ESC180
                 School\First_Year\PHY180\Labs **python files implement a vision tracking library for the lab**
MATLAB:          School\First_Year\ESC103\MATLAB
